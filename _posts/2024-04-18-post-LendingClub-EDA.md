When a company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company. In this case study we will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.If we are able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.In other words, a company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
