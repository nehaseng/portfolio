Hi, I’m Neha — and this space is my creative lab for everything I’m learning in Data Science and Machine Learning.

I started this portfolio to document my journey—every project, experiment, insight, and little breakthrough along the way. For me, learning isn’t just about completing a course or finishing a model; it’s about exploring ideas, trying things that feel new, and turning curiosity into something real.

Here, you’ll find the projects I’m building, the problems I’m trying to solve, and the lessons each one teaches me.
It’s a growing collection of my work, my progress, and my passion for understanding the world through data.

Welcome to my learning journey—one project at a time.
